## Introduction
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

The idea of this project is to use recursive method to solve sudoku puzzle at any level of diffiulties instantenously. This project also develops a command-line interface CLI application and a graphical user interface (GUI) application to provide an intuitive sudoku-solving experience for user.

## Installation

### CLI Application
The source code for [Sudoko_Solver_CLI.exe](Sudoko_Solver_CLI.exe) is [sudoku_solver_core.c](sudoku_solver_core.c). The executable file can be generated by compiling [sudoku_solver_core.c](sudoku_solver_core.c) using C compiler. The compiled executable can be directly excuted and will display command-line interface.

### GUI Application
To get the development environment running, user needs to:
1. Install [Qt 4.7.0 MinGW](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.7/) and [Qt Creator 2.0.1](https://download.qt.io/archive/qtcreator/2.0/). Note that the GUI application in this project is created using **Qt Creator version 2.0.1** which is based on **Qt 4.7.0** and uses **MinGW with GCC version 4.4**. Different version of Qt Creator can be used, but user needs to manually change the Qt version to Qt 4.7.0 and C++ compiler to MinGW with GCC 4.4 in the Kits. Using different version of Qt or MinGW GCC might result in compatibility issue.
2. Download [SudokuSolver.pro](SudokuSolver.pro), [sudokusolver.h](sudokusolver.h), [sudokusolver.ui](sudokusolver.ui), [main.cpp](main.cpp), [sudokusolver.cpp](sudokusolver.cpp), [sudoku.ico](sudoku.ico), [sudokusolver.rc](sudokusolver.rc), and place these files in the same folder.
3. Open [SudokuSolver.pro](SudokuSolver.pro) in Qt Creator. The other neccessary files will be automatically loaded.

The standalone executable GUI application provided in this project, [SudokuSolver.exe](SudokuSolver.exe), can be executed directly in windows machine without any dependencies and does not require installation.

## Features

- **Cell Navigation** : User can move the cursor to the next cell by pressing "Tab".
- **Input Mask** : The application will only accept numeric input from 1 to 9 inclusive.
- **Input Validation** : Invalid user input, such as duplicate number in the same row, column, or 3 x 3 section, will result in Warning pop-up message.
